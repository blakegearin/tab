#### While many of you may be preparing for school by picking out a new backpack or color-coordinating your notebooks for each class, many kids around the world will not be returning to school. This year, we ask you to join us in supporting 100 students learning to read through an amazing organization, Room to Read.

#### This week, all tabs will go toward this goal, and you can help us reach it even faster by inviting your friends to join Tab for a Cause!
